and yet deluded, and
whence ſuch vaine confidence is
derived.

    _ Wherein Faith and Preſumption differ.

    _ Who are weak members of Chriſt.

    _ But if it be inquired what the difference
is between a weak Member
of Chriſt and an hypocrite.

    _ But inaſmuch as the child of God and
an hypocrite both ſtand for repentance,
it may be enquired what the
difference is between the repentance
of the one and of the other.

    _ Sixteene precious and ſoul eſtabliſhing
conſiderations deduced
from the Covenant of
Grace.

    _ The new Covenant no Covenant
properly with us, but with
Chriſt for us.89. Pſa. 28 24 to 38.

    _ When God is ſaid to be in Covenant with
a Soule.

    _ The effect of this Covenant.

    _ Divers inviting Characters, and ſoul-winning
encouragements of faith.

    _ Eleven Motives to believe.

    _ There is but looking up to Chriſt Jeſus,
and ſalvation is in thy ſoule;
and believing with thy heart, and
thou art ſaved:Iſa. 45. 22. thou wert ſaved by
Chriſt before, but now in thy
ſelfe.

    _ How God begets faith in an unbeliever.

    _ When the ſoule is come to believe that
Chriſt was made ſinne for it; its
doubts are vanquiſhed, and the ſoul
ſweetly quieted and ſetled.

    _ Nine Reaſons againſt fears and diſcouragements
in a believer, raiſed from
Iſaiah 41. 10.

    _ One and twenty ſeveral means to be uſed
by poore weake believers, for their
ſettlement in the aſſurance of the
love of God,Iſa. 54. 11 when they are toſſed
with tempeſts, and incompaſſed
with diſcouragements, viz.

    _ A Collection of many the fears, doubts,
and diſcouragements, that a poore
weake believer, either in or about
converſion, or deſertion, takes up
againſt himſelfe, together with
their ſeveral remedies, reſolutions,
and anſwers.

    _ The Remedie.Iſa. 53. 11

    _ The Remedie.

    _ The Diſcouragements of poore weake
believers, herein mentioned, are
as followeth.

    _ Had the Lord Jeſus by his Spirit
wrought an effectual work of grace
upon my heart,2 Diſcouragement I ſhould have
growne in grace; but I doe not ſo,
my life is not holy, nor am I like
unto the Lords children.

    _ My heart is ſo adamantinely hard, that
I can be affected neither with the
chaſtiſements nor mercies of the
Lord.3 Diſcouragement

    _ Becauſe I feele not my ſelfe ſanctified,
I •eare I▪ am not juſtified▪

    _ I cannot ſee God,5 Diſcouragement and if I were one of
his Children, he would not hide
himſelfe from mee,Rom. 8. 24 as he doth:
ſurely he hath forſaken me.

    _ I cannot be perſwaded that God hath
wrought any ſupernatural worke in
me,Job 40. 4, 5. becauſe I have not ſo great a
meaſure of ſorrow for ſinne,Job. 42. 5, 6. as
ſome of the Lords children have.8 Diſcouragement

    _ I feare I have no worke of grace
wrought upon me,9. Diſcouragement. becauſe I feel not
its power, and am not able to ſubdue
my paſſions and corruptions.

    _ I finde within my ſelfe no reliſh of ſpirituall
things,10. Diſcouragement. nor willingneſſe to
duties, and I often omit them.

    _ I feare that that worke of grace,11. Diſcouragement. which
I once felt, is now decayed.

    _ I feare that the oppoſition in mee againſt
ſinne,12. Diſcouragement. is not between Chriſt
and Satan, or the ſpirit and the
fleſh; but betweene my corrupt
will and my inlightened conſcience.

    _ I cannot pray, nor do any thing that is
good, therefore God hath not done
my ſoule good; and I have many
ſuggeſtions that I have no worke
of grace wrought in mee,13. Diſcouragement. which
much weakens my confidence.

    _ My ſoule is filled with terrours;14. Diſcouragement. I
have an Hell within mee, I feele
the wrath of God in my ſoule, and
have for a long time remained
in this condition.

    _ I have no love to Chriſt,15 Diſcouragement. I am an
enemie to him, and not fit for him.

    _ There are indeed many ſweete and precious
promiſes in the word,16 Diſcouragement. but
thoſe who have a propriety in
them are believers, and I am
none.

    _ I have no aſſurance of ſalvation, I
am not ſealed up to the day of redemption,
17 Diſcouragement. and therefore have no
faith.

    _ I feare that my faith is not the faith of
Gods Elect,18 Diſcouragement. but a preſumption,
it being attended with ſo many
doubtings.

    _ I cannot believe that I am elected,19 Diſcouragement.
therefore nothing can doe mee
good.

    _ I am afraid the day of grace is paſt,21. Diſcouragement.
and ſo nothing can doe me good.

    _ Saith a poore drooping believer, I feare
that when perſecution comes,22. Diſcouragement. I
ſhall not ſuffer, nor hold out unto
the end, but diſhonour God, betray
his truth, ſhame and grieve his
people.

    _ I am diſcouraged becauſe that of all the
ſpirituall things I hoped for,23. Diſcouragement. none
are made good to mee; I doe not
poſſeſſe any.

    _ I have many diſcouragements,24. Diſcouragement. for that
I am not filled with joy, and comfort
and peace in believing.

    _ I cannot believe that I am in Chriſt,25 Diſcouragement.
for that I fall back into
ſinne.

    _ Saith a poore drooping believer,26. Diſcouragement. I having
lyen a long time under, and
uſed the means of grace, grow ſtil
worſe and worſe; therefore I
cannot but conclude, That God
wil not doe me good.

    _ I fear that my motions Godward,27 Diſcouragement. doe
flow from a principle of ſelf-love,
and not from pure love unto the
Lord Jeſus.

    _ Saith a poore deſerted ſoule,28. Diſcouragement. I cannot
believe that God wil pardon my ſins,
they being greater and heightned
with many more circumſtances of aggravation
then the ſins of others
are.

    _ But ſaith the poore ſoul,1 Aggravation. my ſins are many.

    _ But mine are after the receiving of many
mercies.3 Aggravation.

    _ Surely if I were not an out-caſt, and a
reprobate,29 Diſcouragement. I ſhould not be left as I
am, in a wilderneſſe condition.

    _ True,30. Diſcouragement. ſaith the poore ſoule, were I a
branch in Chriſt, and a true member
of his houſe, then could I believe
theſe precious truths and promiſes of
his; but I am neither of both, but
ſeparated from him and his people.

    _ A believers comfort, hope, joy, confidence,
&c. ſhould be in God the
ſame at all times.

    _ Six Reaſons of the Point.

    _ Four things, from whence it is that the
children of God have not their comfort,
hope, joy, confidence, &c. the
ſame at all times.

    _ Such as live by faith in infirmities,
live upon Chriſt in his promiſe
for ſtrength againſt all infirmities
in ſuch places of Scripture as
theſe.

    _ To live by faith for Protection, and
ſupply of all wants.
